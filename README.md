C++ Project for CS111

A fun project that grabs from a "input.dat" file that has data on movies within that week.
The program sorts the movies by director, title, rating as well as able to delete movies 
that the user doesn't want to see.

Project shows what I have learned throughout the course.
What was used on this project:
  array
  if else statements
  do while loops
  for loops
  switch cases
  boolean
  methods
  functions
  bubble sorting
